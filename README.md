# Titanic Dataset Analysis & Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using Python and machine learning. It demonstrates end-to-end data science skills, including data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Steps Taken

1. **Data Loading & Visualization**  
   Explored the dataset to understand feature distributions and their impact on survival.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked), and dropped irrelevant columns for clean, model-ready data.

3. **Model Building & Evaluation**  
   Trained multiple classification models and compared their performance:
   - Logistic Regression (baseline) ‚Äî accuracy ~78%  
   - Decision Tree Classifier ‚Äî accuracy ~75%  
   - Random Forest Classifier ‚Äî accuracy ~81% (best performance)

## Key Learnings
- Effective data preprocessing improves model accuracy significantly.  
- Different algorithms capture data patterns uniquely; ensemble methods like Random Forest improve robustness.  
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report) provide deep insights into model performance.

## Next Steps
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy  
- Exploring additional models (SVM, KNN)  
- Deploying the model for real-world applications or building an interactive dashboard
